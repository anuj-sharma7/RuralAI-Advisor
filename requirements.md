Project Name: RuralAI Advisor

Overview:
RuralAI Advisor is an AI-powered, multilingual, offline-capable rural ecosystem platform designed for smallholder farmers in India. The system leverages AWS-native serverless architecture and AI/ML models to improve agricultural productivity, income stability, and resource efficiency.

Problem Statement:
Smallholder farmers in India face:
- 30–40% crop losses due to pest, disease, and climate variability
- 20–30% income loss due to price exploitation and lack of market transparency
- Limited access to financial services
- Low digital literacy
- Poor internet connectivity in rural areas

Objectives:
1. Increase crop yield by 10–15%
2. Increase farmer income by 20–30%
3. Reduce input costs by 15–20%
4. Enable financial inclusion
5. Provide offline-first access

Target Users:
- Small and marginal farmers
- Rural cooperatives
- Agri-extension workers

Core Features:
1. AI-powered multilingual voice assistant
2. Crop disease detection using CNN models
3. Yield prediction using XGBoost regression
4. Price forecasting using Temporal Fusion Transformer
5. Hyperlocal weather alerts
6. Digital marketplace linkage
7. Microfinance and credit scoring
8. Offline-first capability
9. Farmer dashboard analytics
